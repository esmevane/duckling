# Duckling

A petite Java http server, with the major goals of being enjoyable to read and well tested.  So named because the original author's son loves ducks (and also pigeons); it's not a Hans Christian Andersen reference, promise.

## Installation

Duckling is released with a `duckling.jar`, which is runnable through Java:

```bash
java ./duckling.jar
```

You can also configure the port (with `-p`) and root directory (with
`-d`):

```bash
java duckling.jar -p $(YOUR_FAVORITE_PORT) -d $(YOUR_FAVORITE_DIR)
```
